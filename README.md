## Introduction

I am an adaptable and reliable **Junior Full Stack Developer**, looking for a new role in the development team
  
After having worked on the sales side of digital products for more than 6+ years (within tech companies); I realised it is programming and solving problems that I enjoy more.  Now equipped with best engineering practices gained through Makers Developer Bootcamp, I am really excited to use my digital technical skills to help turn ideas into innovative new features, products & services.  

I would describe myself as someone who is open minded, a good learner (self-taught Japanese and lived in Japan for 2 years), with a positive attitude and strong methodical approach which I'll bring when working with people from all walks of life.
